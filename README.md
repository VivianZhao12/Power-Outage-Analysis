# Power-Outage-Analysis
This is a project for DSC 80 at UCSD.

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Power-Outage-Analysis" project repository! This project aims to explore the relationship between fuel supply emergencies and the duration of power outages. The dataset used in this analysis provides valuable information on power outage events, regional climate characteristics, regional electricity consumption, and regional economic indicators.

The main question that drives our analysis is: **"Does fuel supply emergency lead to longer power outage durations?"** We seek to investigate whether power outages caused by fuel supply emergencies tend to have longer durations compared to other causes of outages. By examining this relationship, we can gain insights into the impact of fuel supply emergencies on the reliability and resilience of the power grid.
